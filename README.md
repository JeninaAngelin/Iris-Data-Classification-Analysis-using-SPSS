# Iris Data Classification Analysis using SPSS

This repository contains code and resources for performing classification analysis on the Iris dataset using IBM SPSS Statistics software.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a famous dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements of various iris flowers, categorized into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. In this project, we utilize SPSS to analyze this dataset and build classification models to predict the species of iris flowers based on their measurements.
